    "This notebook demonstrates the key features of the Chess AI toolkit for feature explainability analysis and interactive chess gameplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Chess AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive chess AI toolkit featuring:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Explainability Audit**: Evaluate how well chess features explain Stockfish's evaluations using machine learning\n",
    "2. **Explainable Chess Engine**: Play against Stockfish with move explanations and learning feedback  \n",
    "3. **Advanced Positional Metrics**: Sophisticated chess position analysis including passed pawn momentum, king safety, and piece activity\n",
    "4. **Kendall Tau Correlation**: Statistical analysis of move ranking correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- Understand why chess engines make specific moves\n",
    "- Learn chess through interactive gameplay with explanations\n",
    "- Analyze chess positions using advanced metrics\n",
    "- Research chess AI explainability"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo shows the Chess AI toolkit's capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Extraction**: Analyze chess positions using comprehensive feature sets including material, mobility, king safety, and tactical elements\n",
    "2. **Move Analysis**: Get explanations for why moves are good or bad with specific reasoning\n",
    "3. **Positional Metrics**: Advanced analysis of passed pawns, king safety, and piece activity\n",
    "4. **Interactive Learning**: Play chess with real-time move explanations and feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Full Feature Audit**: `chess-ai audit --baseline_features --positions 100`\n",
    "- **Interactive Play**: `chess-ai play --strength intermediate`  \n",
    "- **Custom Features**: Create your own feature extraction functions\n",
    "- **Research**: Use the toolkit for chess AI explainability research\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation & Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install the toolkit\n",
    "pip install chess-ai\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run feature audit\n",
    "chess-ai audit --positions 50\n",
    "\n",
    "# Play interactive chess\n",
    "chess-ai play --strength beginner\n",
